My first ever game in Unity, it's a basic 2D platformer. Here's where everything began.

Controls:  
A - Move Left  
D - Move Right  
Space - Jump  
Shift - Shoot Bullet  

To get to some platforms you need to perform a special jump mechanic, stick to the wall of the platform and then jump again.
There are 50 coin per each stage, 100 coins total.
